- [ ] Don't explode when parsing a multi line variable
- [ ] Clean up using a signal (remove the temp file) Not sure this is possible inside a function
- [ ] Add option to make `abbr`s instead of `alias`es
- [ ] Replace common bash syntax with the equivalent fish syntax
  - [ ] `||` -> `; or`
  - [ ] `&&` -> `; and`
- [ ] Add function parsing How did bass do it? -- just read in the string for each function and create a fish wrapper that calls `bash -c "$function_body"`?
